Setting up your roboRIO
=======================

.. note::
    The best practice while doing anything roboRIO setup related is to use a USB-B cable. Wireless connections may throw errors that would be easily avoidable with the use of a cable.

Setting your roboRIO team number
---------------------------------

To set the roboRIO's team number, you have 2 options.

#. 1. Set the team number in the **roboRIO Imaging Tool** while formatting the correct image on to the roboRIO.
#. 2. Use the **roboRIO Team Number Setter 202X** application to connect to the roboRIO, and change the team number there.
